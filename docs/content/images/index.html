      Use one of the built-in CNVS classes to support responsive behavior for your images.

    </p>

    <p>

      Images, denoted by the all-enduring <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, have been a starter in the markup playbook since the early days of the internet.  However, they offer very little in form of responsive sizing or styling.  CNVS attempts to solve this.
