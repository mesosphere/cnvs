      Containers provide basic layout functionality. The term "container" has been borrowed from Twitter's Bootstrap, and is meant to imply an element that wraps or "contains" content.

    </p>

    <p>

      In Canvas, containers can be used independent of the <a href="/layout/grid">Grid System</a>. Properties such as a width and margin for the container vary depending on both the class and screen resolution. Choose from a responsive, fixed-width container (meaning its max-width changes at each breakpoint) or fluid-width (meaning it’s 100% wide all the time).

    </p>
